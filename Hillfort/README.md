# The Hillfort Manifest

If you're reading this, be prepared for some confusion. **Hillfort** is a personal system (part lifestyle/philosophy/mindset, part set of tools) that I’ve built to organize my life. I built it for myself and my day-to-day organization, therefore it is not made for public adoption. I'm sharing it here because some friends might find it useful, or at least interesting.

Over the past few years (starting somewhere around 2023), I’ve slowly shaped a set of habits and workflows to help me keep my health, studies, and work under control (I've also been diagnosed with the 'tism since then - coincidence? I think not!)

The Hillfort is not designed for anyone to be more productive or get a better routine. Tools can only get you so far, there is a BIG amount of habit-making and internal personal changes you need to do that. That is, this system is not for turning anyone into “10x” anything. For me, it works to lower anxiety, organize my routine, organize my digital assets, staying sane, and making life a little more manageable with (especially while dealing with the kind of mental patterns that don’t always fit into neat boxes).

So, back again: this is not supposed to be universally “good” or “usable.” It’s personal. It’s how I do things. I may expand it, try to share it to others, but deep down it's just another tool. If it manages to help you in any way, then great. You’re welcome to take ideas from it, adapt it, or ignore it. And if you have thoughts or feedback, I’m happy to hear them.

## 1. The Name

The name Hillfort refers to a small fortified refuge common in the Iron Age. I didn’t think too hard when choosing it, I just have a particular interest in the Bronze and Iron Age, and on the day I first started this, I was thinking about the historical Baltic piliakalnis/pilskalns.

In the end, it reflects something that should be simple, functional, and self-made (in contrast to fancier structures like castles or palaces). Raised earthworks to hold inside them what matters: your day-to-day life. A kind of “center” for the people (you) around it.

That’s why some tools or subprojects may have names like Semigallia or Moat. It’s just a loose naming convention that fits the mood (I’ll touch on conventions later.)

By default, the short name the entire system takes is ```hfort```.

## 2. Core Principles

**1. Self-sufficiency:** Whenever possible, I prefer building things from scratch or trying the most stripped-down version first. Complex products are a last resort. I value tools that are simple, can be run locally, and open-source. If I depend on something, I want to understand it and be able to fix it if it breaks. Moreover, it helps the "built to last" philosophy on principle 2.

**2. Function over Flair:** I favor formats that are easy to inspect and edit with a text editor: `.md`, `.csv`, `.sh`. I avoid things that require layers of abstraction or locked-in software. The simpler the file, the longer it lasts.

**3. Not for Scale:** As mentioned previously, this system is not designed for large adoption. It’s made for one person for personal use, and may attract the interest of a few friends who share the mindset.

**4. Handcrafted for Personal Tates:** I choose tools that fit my way of thinking, and my way of interacting with the world, even if they aren’t the fastest, "easiest" or trendiest. A system that works for my habits -  slowly, weirdly, sometimes awkwardly — is better than one that’s perfectly efficient but alien.

**5. Design for Imperfection**

Everything in Hillfort is expected to evolve. Notes change. Systems rot. Habits drift. That is not failure, it’s just life. The system should be designed to grow and adapt with those shifts.

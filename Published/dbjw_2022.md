**Abstract** 

As societies become increasingly interconnected and digital, data inherently becomes more abundant, and hence the question of “who owns my data'' becomes ever more eminent. While the usage of data brings countless advantages to facilitate improved user experience and make our daily lives easier. In the same stroke, it also brings many problems, such as: personal data leaks, or profiling for political or financial gain. Currently, it is difficult to develop preventive measures to mitigate the negative effects of data usage because we as a society are not informed about how our data is being shared, used and catered to us. As a result, we need to start thinking about ways of bringing back control to individual users. 

In  this  paper,  we  will  explain  the  terms:  data literacy and data transparency. Furthermore, we will point out why they are necessary for a strong European future and how these aspects lead us to the importance of an increase in data autonomy. In our last section, we will describe what a conceptual solution for increased data autonomy could look like - in the form of what we call a "data wallet". With this solution we want to demonstrate how an application that builds on data transparency and data  literacy  can  improve  an  individual’s  agency  in accessing and controlling their shared data. Our appendix additionally  includes  a  first  prototype  concept  for interested readers. Additionally, our data literacy library provides helpful links for the reader to inform themselves about this topic.  

**Introduction**  

By  the  time  you  have  finished  reading  this sentence, nearly 200 million emails will have been sent, 69 million WhatsApp messages exchanged, and 695,000 instagram stories shared (Jenik, 2021). The pace at which data  is  being  created,  shared,  and  stored  is incomprehensible  and  is  changing  and  shaping  our society  more  than  we  can  pathom.  To  put  it  into perspective, over a decade ago it was estimated that every two days we created as much information as we did from the beginning of civilization to 2003 - that is around 5 billion gigabytes (Siegler, 2010). Today, in 2021, it is estimated  that  2.5  quintillion  bytes  of  data  are  being created daily (Johnson, 2021).  

While there are many possible questions that can follow from this, one question that this policy paper will focus on is: who owns all of this data? The individuals who create it? According to the current model, the answer is: no. Up until now, the business model of some of the largest tech companies in the world is based on using individual’s data for profit. Back in 2006 UK Mathematician Dr. James Bellini coined the saying, “Data is the new oil of the 21st century.” And over a decade later, what he said became  reality.  In  2018,  the  Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal brought mainstream light to how user data is utilized for profit. It also shed light on the topics of data security and data misuse. This scandal continues today in the form of psychological targeting via advertisement, both political and commercial by nature. What we are being shown is altering who we are, what we think, what we buy, what we believe and who we vote for. Steps in order to attenuate such data transparency issues have been taken by the European Commission in the past,  for  example  under  the  General  Data  Protection Regulation  (GDPR)  of  2018.  However,  we  argue  that enough is not being done.  

Hence,  under  the  motto  of  the  German-Batlic Conference 2021, “European Answers on how to shape our future,” we want to be able to live a life free of data worries.  We  want  to  be  free  of  advertisements  which subconsciously influence who we are, what decisions we take and ultimately know the answer to the question: “who owns our data.”  

The  purpose  of  this  policy  paper  is  to  urge European politicians to put the topic of “who owns my data” on the top of their agendas in order to live in a society without worrying about who owns my data and what is being done with it. In order to achieve this goal, this paper will be structured in a two-step approach. First, we will explain the concept of data autonomy, comprised of its two main pillars: data literacy and data transparency. Both are important for data governance in a digital world. In contrast to data sovereignty, which is connected to statehood, data autonomy is the concept of the individual being not only capable of seeing how their data is being used and shared, but also being capable of analyzing it in a critical manner and acting to restrict or permit its usage. 

In a second step, we will propose how a so-called “data wallet” could be a step towards data autonomy. In this data wallet, the user would be able to access and track- in an unified dashboard. In this dashboard, the user would be able to see where data is being shared, who is using the data and for what purposes.  

Finally,  our  paper  will  conclude  with  how  the concept  of  data  autonomy  should  be  discussed  and practiced in the near future - be it in the political or social sphere. 

<a name="_page9_x68.00_y106.00"></a>**Why is data autonomy important?** 

Why  is  data  autonomy  important  to  us?  It  is important  because  the  way  our  data  is  being  broadly exploited and monetized by big social media and analytics companies is not acceptable. We, as the European youth, wish to have a future without data worries, and we think there are many possible solutions for these problems.  

Though at first sight, the digital services we use appear "free" they are not. We pay with our personal experience, which is collected in the form of the data we leave behind. 

According  to  the  “Data  Monetization  Market Report  Scope”  the market  size  value of  data  in 2020 reached USD 1.62 billion. Revenue forecast for 2027 has been  estimated  as  USD  7.34  billion.  (Grand  View Research, 2020). The moments of realization, that we have  been  watched,  and  our  information  has  been gathered for years can be quite frightening. Some tech companies  might  know  more  about  us  than  we  do ourselves. How can it be that our actions online can be predicted and for example after searching for travel blogs, to let us say France, then on the next web pages we will be confronted with ads for travel agencies offering good deals on a trip to Paris. This way of action can only be possible through data analysing algorithms and software, otherwise known as cookies.  

At the same time, extreme examples like the so- called Cambridge Analytica scandal shows how our own data can be used to push us into socially undesirable directions.  In  the  wake  of  the  2016  US  Presidential Elections and the BREXIT referendum in Great Britain, undecided  voters  (referred  to  as  persuadables)  were targeted  on  a  fine-grained  basis  to  push  them  into  a certain political direction. (“The Great Hack” Karim Amer, Jehane  Noujaim  2019).  All  of  this  happened  in  a completely intransparent way, making it impossible for the individuals to know if they were targeted at all and why they were put into which kind of category. 

The data collected can be used as a psychological weapon,  as  described  by  the  people  confessing throughout the Cambridge Analytica process. People's decisions during elections can and have been influenced by  such  strategies  which  consist  of  invading  voters privacy, and is certainly considered to be a violation of democratic elections.**  

Though at first sight, the digital services we use appear "free" they are not. We pay with our personal experience, which is collected in the form of the data we leave behind. 

Worrying  about  your  personal  data  is cumbersome. Even with regulations in place, such as the GDPR, to allow users to access the data companies have about them - it is likely most people will not use them. Not only  does  the  user  need  to  personally  contact  every different company and ask for their data (which involves emails and a considerable amount of time), the data he will have access to will be almost unintelligible for most people - with every company giving different structures, data types and no explanation of it. This would leave only the most radical data privacists to use such regulations in their favour. 

Furthermore, we are trying to avoid falling into problems  such  as  creating new  regulations, or  ethical questions  such  as  who  would  store  this  data.  The objective with this solution is to make something truly applicable in real life and useful for users 

Before exploring what we call "data wallet" as a potential way to regain transparency about data practices, we want to first dive deeper into the concept of "data autonomy".

<a name="_page12_x68.00_y97.00"></a>**How do we want to change the status quo of data autonomy?** 

We believe that data is something that inherently belongs to the individual that has created it. In this regard, we define data autonomy as follows: individuals (referred to as data subjects) should have the ability to understand and  control  their  flow  of  data  and  rebuke  consent  if desired.  

Before  expanding  on  what  we  mean  by  data autonomy  in  more  detail,  we  want  to  stress  a  few important aspects the existing General Data Protection Regulation  has  already  achieved  towards  data autonomy[^1]: 

First, the GDPR defines the territorial scope of data processing and gives data rights to every subject in and of the European Union. This is important becasue it pins the global flow of data to European jurisdiction and provides the individual with new ways to exercise their rights in a digital world. Next, it goes on defining important terms such as “personal data”, “profiling”, “processing”, and many more. This is important in order to create and cultivate an informed public discourse around the topic of data protection. Finally, it lays down rules for the lawful processing of personal data and most importantly, defines essential rights of data subjects. To highlight only a few, these include for example: 

- Transparency  to  how  data  is  collected  and processed (Article 12) 
- Information and access to personal data (Article 13) 
- The right to be forgotten (Article 17) 
- Right to data portability (Article 20) 

Although this is only a small selection from the whole regulatory body, these articles are already crucial steps  in  an  attempt  to  achieve  data  autonomy.  They define obligations for the owner and processor of data and lay the basis for control of individual subjects when it comes to access, transparency and control. 

We want to build upon GDPR outlined above to expand individual control into what we call data autonomy. We define data autonomy as: *the ability of the individual users  to  access,  view  and  control  their  data  either individually or in exchange with others.*  

In this regard our concept of data autonomy refers to mechanisms of self-government and is built upon two main pillars: *data literacy* (1) and *data transparency* (2)*.* Ideally, they should be considered as complementary in order  for  any  form  of  regulation  to  achieve  maximal impact. 

1) We believe that the start of any meaningful 

decision about the processing of one’s data, data subjects need to be aware of the relevant terms. They should know what *data* is, how data *processing* works and why it is important to care about this topic in the first place. Parts of this are already covered in the GDPR but we believe that  policy  makers  should  put  a  greater  emphasis  on making the subject in general more understandable and put greater emphasis on educating the general public. This could include cross-national courses on educating data subjects around the European Union. We see this also as a cross-generational task. With one the one side, new kids, teenagers and young adults joining data driven services. They need to be educated about how their data is used and how this affects and in some ways even manipulates them into certain undesirable directions. On the other side, we also have an increasing number of elderly people joining networks and services without any prior knowledge of data usage. Finding ways to educate the general public about these issues is a crucial pillar towards any kind of data autonomy. 

Besides  the  definitions  already  included  in  the GDPR we would believe having clarity over the following is important to stress: 

- Overview of different data types,  
- Explanation  of  metadata  and  why  the  exact content often doesn’t matter 
- Cookies and why they are on every website we visit 
- The meaning and relevance of *big* data 
- What algorithms are and how they differ from learning systems, and 
- Different types of data governance models 

This list is by far exhaustive. It does, however, serve as a starting point to enlarge the discussion about data usage in our contemporary digital societies. It helps to raise awareness for how data is being used and builds the basis for any informed decision about how we want to treat data processing in the future. To further add to this, we  started  collecting  links  to  important  publications, podcasts, books, etc. that can be found at the end of this publication in the *Data Literacy Library* section. 

2) Although knowledge about these basic terms is 

necessary to make any informed decisions about data processing, in itself it is insufficient. Informed choices - whether *consent* to data collection practices in general, the *choice* of what specific service to use or ultimately *control* over one’s datasets - need to be complemented with transparency about data collection practices. This brings us to our second pillar: *data transparency* 

We believe that ‘seeing’ is an important step to ‘understanding’. Thus it is decisive to have access to the particular dataset which companies are storing and for what reason they access what type of data. This is, at this point, largely unknown to the general public. 

A  second  advantage  in  transparency  is  that requiring companies to be transparent about their data processing activities by default can incentivize companies to  change  their  business  model  into  less  data-driven directions or at least minimize the amount of data they collect. We believe that the more transparency there is the stronger this incentive will be and that transparency will strengthen the agency of public interest to intervene in private commercial entities. 

Again, GDPR has been a milestone towards data transparency. As mentioned above chapter two outlines many different rights of data subjects such as access to datasets  in  question  (Article  12)  or  the  right  to  erase existing datasets (the right to be forgotten’) (Article 17).  In its current form however, we believe this practice to be too spread out. Individual users have to request their data from each firm individually. This can prove to overburden the individuals which leads them to shying away from exercising  this  right,  ultimately  leaving  this  possibility underused. 

We therefore want to take the possibilities granted in the GDPR one step further by introducing the idea of the so-called *data wallet.* The data wallet is an application that  pools  the  information  about  every  data  subject’s usage.  It  lists  all  the  companies  that  have  accessed different types of data from each respective data subject. As such the data wallet serves the purpose to not only require firms to grant access to the different types of data they have over their customers, or to afford customers a clear right of access to the data maintained by respective firms  but  to  centralize  and  visualize  existing  data processing practices.  

As such, the data wallet automates the process of getting the data, and furthermore, structuring it in a user- friendly dashboard where any “average” user could easily see how their data is being used and for what purposes. The main advantage we believe the data wallet to bring is *centralization*. Individual citizens would only have to open an application which displays the different categories of data respective companies own about them.  

Centrally  visualizing  how  one’s  data  is  being processed in an easy and understandable way is a very important step towards data transparency and thus data autonomy. At the same time, we acknowledge that this alone might not solve the problem of the overburdened data subject fully.  This is why we envision the data wallet to not only visualize one’s data but to also be a place for communities  to  form  and  exchange  around  data protection  strategies.  We  will  deepen  this  idea  in  the following section. 

Overall, we believe that data autonomy is central for achieving a life without data worries. We understand data autonomy as being built on two main pillars: data literacy and data transparency. Both of them are central for achieving the overarching goal of autonomy and only in combination work together to achieve maximum impact. 

To  achieve  this  we  need  policy  makers  to emphasize the importance of literacy. We need cross- country cooperation to educate a great mass of digital users. At the same time, to achieve transparency in the form envisioned above we need stronger cross-sectoral cooperation and bring technicians, engineers and social scientists  together  to  build  something  meaningful  for future digital societies. 

<a name="_page18_x68.00_y95.00"></a>**What a conceptual solution to increase data autonomy could be?** 

**Why a Data Wallet?** 

As discussed previously, it is important to explore how our ideas and solutions would work in society. For that  reason,  we  created a  proposed  model of  a  Data Wallet - one “app” which would help users regain their autonomy when managing their data and understand how it is being used 

The idea of an app to help users face or manage how their data is being used is not entirely new. Since the 2017 UK elections, a group of activists called *Who Targets Me*[^2]* created a browser plugin to allow users to see which political parties were using ads to target them or their demographic. Currently, this plugin already has more than 50 thousand users and it is an example of how we could use technology to reach Data Autonomy.  

Currently, the prototype is available on[ this link](https://andreispurim.github.io/data_wallet/)[^3] with the source code being available[ here](https://github.com/AndreisPurim/data_wallet)[^4]. It must be noted that the Data Wallet we propose is not the final product of our paper, but rather a tool to explain how the concept of Data Autonomy could be applied on a larger scale: not only for political elections but to all data. It is of course one of the many possible implementations of the concept and is a *mockup* prototype (not a functional app). The objective is to show how it could be used, and for politicians how they could work towards a practical solution.

**The Problem we are Trying to Solve** 

Worrying  about  your  personal  data  is cumbersome. Even with regulations in place, such as the GDPR, to allow users to access the data companies have about them - it is likely most people will not use them. Not only  does  the  user  need  to  personally  contact  every different company and ask for their data (which involves emails and a considerable amount of time), the data he will have access to will be almost unintelligible for most people - with every company giving different structures, data types and no explanation of it. This would leave only the most radical data privacists to use such regulations in their favor.

Furthermore, we are trying to avoid falling into problems such as  *creating*  new  regulations,  or ethical  questions  such  as  who would store this data. The objective with  this  solution  is  to  make something truly applicable in real life and useful for users 

Our  main  inspirations  - aside  *Who Targets Me*  - are the existing  Digital  Wallets  and  the Estonian digital ID (which serve to centralize information from multiple services, such as our Data Wallet aims  to  do)  and  the ScreenTime app, an app that allows users to see how much time they spend on each app. In our case, it would not be  the  time,  but  rather  the information.

<a name="_page21_x68.00_y93.00"></a>**Conclusion** 

The purpose of this paper is to inspire the policy makers into thinking about potential solutions of getting closer to the concept of data autonomy. The data wallet we  propose  gives  the  ordinary  users  full  capacity  to control who should own their personal data and what type of data can be shared. This way we are reaching for data transparency  and  literacy  which  are  bound  to  be fundamental  rights  of  the  citizens  in  the  digital  world. Taking into consideration the feasibility of this solution, we would like to fully acknowledge the technical scalability complications of the Data Wallet concept. Nevertheless we  strongly  believe  that  thinking  about  ways  to accommodate technology users in gaining full control of the data they produce in the digital environment, makes the  societies  we  live  in  more  democratic,  intact  and reputable.**

**Abstract.**  Different  from  western  military  doctrine,  the  Russian  concept  of  cyberwarfare  is intrinsically related to Information Warfare. Instead of cyber operations being a complement to kinetic operations, such as disrupting enemy infrastructure, Russia defines them as a subset of information warfare, and thus, as a soft power non-kinetic way to influence other countries. This has caused western analysts to misinterpret the objective and successes of past Russian solely  on  tactical  gains.  This  paper  aims  to  explain  the  concept  of  cyber  warfare  from  the Russian perspective, its evolutions from 2007 until 2022, and what are the perspectives for the future of cyberwarfare. 

**Keywords.** Cybersecurity, Cyberwarfare, Cyber Attack, Information Warfare, Ukraine, Russia.


# 1. Introduction 

On  23rd  February  2022,  the  day  before  the beginning  of   Russian  military  operations,  several Ukrainian  government  websites  and  banks  were taken  down  by  denial-of-service  attacks  [1].  At midnight, a hitherto unknown data-wiping malware was released in the country [2]. 

These attacks, together with previous incidents such as the hacking of Ukraine’s power grid in 2016 [3] led many to believe the war in Ukraine would be a redefinition of hybrid and conventional warfare [4]. While  the  conflict  is  still  unfolding,  the  use  of cyberattacks has so far not given Russian forces the expected  strategic  and  tactical  advantage,  which renewed  debate  on  the  role  of  cyberattacks  in warfare [5]. Thus, the question remains: Why have Russian cyberattacks not been useful for achieving their military goals in Ukraine? 

This paper aims to explain the concept of Russian cyberwarfare and its evolution from 2007 to 2022. Highlighting  the  idea  of  Information  warfare  and contrasting  it  with other countries, this  study will propose  why  the  Russian  doctrine  lacked  tactical cyberwarfare planning for the invasion. It will also put  forth  some  new  metrics  for  evaluation  of cyberoperations and ideas for future research, and a framework for responding to these attacks. 

# 2. Methodology
## 2.1. Definitions of Cyberwarfare

Richard  Clarke  defines  cyberwar  as  “actions  by  a nation-state  to  penetrate  another  nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption” [6], and thus, is a subset of hybrid  warfare,  characterized  by  the  use  of  non- state actors and non-military (non-kinetic) means to achieve  military  (kinetic)  objectives  [7].  Both definitions are debated among academics because of their  ambiguity  (either  in  the  legal  [8]  or  police- making [9] perspectives). There is also a distinction between cyberwarfare and cyberwar in scope and impact [10].

Every  country  has  its  own  military  doctrine,  and thus, its own perception of cyberwarfare. Rarely is the  word  cyberwarfare  (kibervoyna),  rather,  the concept  inside  the  broader  idea  of  information warfare  (informatsionnaya  voyna)  [11].  The Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation (2010) states  that  a  modern  conflict  features  “prior implementation of measures of information warfare in order to achieve political objectives without the utilization of military force and, subsequently, in the interest  of  shaping  a  favorable  response  from  the world  community  to  the  utilization  of  military force.” [12]. 

Thus,  Russian  military  thinking  aggregates 

cyberattacks in the same field as disinformation and psychological  operations,  and  thus  takes  a supporting role [11]. Also, Russian Cyberwarfare is also not a tactical, limited operation in wartime, but a continuous struggle for information control [13]. Therefore,  Clarke’s  definition  is  still  sufficiently valid, and this analysis will consider “cyberattack” a punctual  action  (i.e.  the  hacking  of  websites) component  of  a  larger,  time-limited  “cyber operation”  (i.e.  the  actions  leading  up  to  the invasion in 2022), which itself is a component of a continuous “cyberwarfare” – each operation will be separated by scope, target and evaluated. 

## 2.2. Criteria of success of a cyber operation

J. A. Lewis measures the success of a cyberwarfare operation with two metrics: 1. Strategic Effect: the reduction of an opponent’s will or capacity to resist; 2. Military effect: the degradation of an opponent’s military  capabilities,  be  they  weapons,  troops,  or command  and  control  [14]. The  latter  describes a western  approach  to  cyberwarfare,  while  the former is more aligned with the Russian doctrine. 

However,  this  division  on  the  metric  is  unclear  if attacks  on  civilian  infrastructure  are  considered  a strategic  effect  or  a  military  one.  Therefore,  this study  proposes  redefining  the  metrics  as  1. Information/Morale  Effect:  reduction  of  an opponent’s  will  or  capacity  to  resist,  be  it  from  a long-term  shift  in  public  opinion  or  short-term ‘shock  and  awe’  and  2.  Infrastructural  effect: degradation  of  the  opponent’s  physical  or  digital infrastructure,  be  they  civilian  or  military  –  also takes into account cyberespionage or the threat to another country’s system by unauthorized access. 

## 2.3. Allegations of State Involvement 

Cyberattacks  are  generally  conducted  by anonymous  individual  or  groups  with  untraceable origins,  thus  creating  a  legal  gray  zone  where countries have plausible deniability, as these actors can be either state officials, state-sponsored groups, or acting on their own for the advancement of their country. [8] 

While  minor  incidents  such  as  DDoS  attacks  are easily  reproducible  by  individuals,  complex software  such  as  Stuxnet  can  only  be  developed with resources from nation-states. [8] “Fancy Bear" and “Sandworm”, two cyberespionage groups, have been  identified  as  units  within  the  GRU  (Russia’s Main  Intelligence  Directorate),  with  6  Russian operatives being indicted by the US Department of Justice in 2020 [15]. 

“Fancy  Bear”,  for  example,  is  classified  as  an advanced  persistent  threat,  whose  operatives  are Russian  speakers  and  operate  in  a  timezone consistent with Moscow and St. Petersburg, finally, their goals are focused on collecting intelligence (as opposed to economic gain) in the post-soviet sphere that  would  be  useful  for  governments,  especially Russia [16].

# 3 Evolution of Russian Cyberwarfare
## 3.1 Post-soviet sphere from 2007

During April and May 2007, Estonian websites were attacked  by  denial-of-service  attacks  in  what  is considered “the first large-scale coordinated use of cyber by Russia to affect a strategic  outcome in a neighboring  state”  and  were  followed  by  Russia demanding  to  freeze  diplomatic  ties  and  impose sanctions  on  Estonia.  The  operation  started  only hours  after  the  Estonian  government  decided  to move a Soviet statue from its location [11]. 

Similar attacks took place in Lithuania in June 2008 and  Kyrgyzstan  in  2009  with  DoS  attacks  in response to opposition to the Russian government  [17].  Similar,  low-intensity  operations  continued throughout  the  decade,  with  the  last  notable example  was  an  attack  on  the  Latvian  Election Commission in 2018 [18]. 

Analysts  consider  the  infrastructural  effect  was minimal,  as  relations  between  the  countries normalized and websites were restored [14]. But in the  information  field,  Russia  demonstrated  that  it could  interfere  and  coerce  neighboring  countries without  triggering  an  international  response,  with the Estonian Minister of Defense declaring  “the aim (...)  was  to  destabilize  Estonian  society,  creating anxiety  among  people  that  nothing  is  functioning, the  services  are  not  operable,  this  was  clearly psychological terror in a way” [11]. This pattern will continue  to  be  fundamental  to  Russian cyberwarfare thinking up to 2022. 

## 3.2. **Russo-Georgian War (2008)** 

The  cyber-attacks  in  Georgia  started  on  July  20, 2008 -  three weeks before the Russian invasion - being the first time attacks in the cybersphere were coordinated  and  coincided  with  direct  armed hostilities. These attacks included the redirection of Georgian servers to other countries, the creation of fake  news,  a  significant  slowdown  in  access  to government  sites  [17][16].  In  matters  of  impact, however,  there  is  no  evidence  suggesting permanent infrastructural damage by the attacks or a decrease in Georgian morale. 

## 3.3. **Ukraine (2014-2022)** 

The  first  attacks  on  the  information  system  of private  and  state  institutions  in  Ukraine  were recorded during the protests in 2013 and from 2014 were often coincidental to kinetic actions in Crimea and  Eastern  Ukraine  [5].  Many  of  the  low-scale actions  are  relayed  on  DDoS  attacks,  which  are similar to previous actions and do not cause much damage.   Some  sophisticated  Russian  operations must be highlighted:  

First,  Operation  Snake  (2013-2014),  a  surge  of detected cases of infection of information systems of Ukraine  with  a  computer  worm  with  rootkit, nicknamed “the snake”. [19] Secondly. CyberBerkut, a  pro-russian  group,  togheter  with  Fancy  Bear, conducted several operations hacking and exposing private documents about Ukranian officials. [20] 

Then, from 2016. “Fancy Bear” developed Xagent, a malware,  which  stole  information  from  SMS content, call log, and the geolocation of the infected device. It was also claimed that it could be used to hack  Ukranian’s  D-30  Howitzer  artillery  [21]  and “Sandworm”  developed  Petya,  a  family  of ransomware encrypting malware developed by the “Sandworm”  group.  Later,  new  variants  such  as NotPetya, BadRabbit and WannaCry are belived to be derived from Petya. [22] 

These  refined  attacks  show  the  level  of  resources and capabilities of the Russian Government. While previous attacks in Georgia and Estonia were mainly for morale purposes, the attacks on Ukraine  show infrastructural aims, such as collecting the location of devices or wiping and encryption of government data. This is further reinforced by the cyberattacks on  Energy  Companies  in  Ukraine  (2015-2017), which  show  a  Russian  focus  on  damaging  energy infrastructure,  further  reinforcing  European dependency on Russian oil and gas [3]. 

## 3.4. **Ukraine (2022)** 

On January 14, 2022, about 22 government agencies and  70  Ukrainian  websites  were  hacked.  On February 23, regular attacks were made on banking and  government  sites  with  the  HermeticWiper virus, a new malware detected by ESET. This virus file system was named with taunts against the US government and President Biden [23]. 

At  midnight  on  the  24th,  the  Kyiv  Regional  State Administration was attacked and numerous e-mails with  pishing  links  were  sent  to  Ukrainian servicemen. This attack was identified by Google to be originated from “Fancy Bear”. [24] 

Furthermore,  SMS  were  sent  to  the  phones  of Ukrainian  citizens  falsely  relating  that  certain regions or cities had already been invaded, causing panic. This indicates that some breach of private or government data regarding private phone numbers was also executed. [25] 

However, these attacks failed to give any advantage to the Russian ground forces. The reasons for such will be discussed in the next topic. 

# 4. **Discussion**  
## 4.1. **Doctrines from other Countries** 

While the Russian doctrine is focused on continuous information warfare, USA and Israeli doctrines fall into  the  western  definition  of  tactical,  limited operations with a clear goal integrated in combined arms  warfare  [13]  Israel  is  an  example  of cyberwarfare doctrine fully integrated in combined arms  warfare,  with  the  Stuxnet  virus  targeting enemy infrastructure [28]. 

Meanwhile, China has had a similar view to Russia on Information Warfare, with recent developments on  the  concept  of  cyberwarfare  [29].  This idiosyncrasy  should  be  noted  when  analyzing  or preparing cyberoperations. 

## 4.2. **A Synthesis of Russian Cyberwarfare** 

As explained  in the methodology  chapter, Russian Military Doctrine regards cyberwarfare as a tool for information  control,  not  part  of  combined  arms warfare [13]. It is clear that Russia has the technical capabilities and resources of creating sophisticated malware, as evidenced by the operations in Ukraine (2014-2022)  [17].  However,  regarding  back  the Russian  Military  Doctrine  document  emited  by President  Vladmir  Putin  in  2010,  the  focus  is  of informational warfare “implementation of measures of information warfare in order to achieve political objectives without the utilization of military force” [12]. 

This explains why Russian ground forces have failed to  capitalize  on  hacker  attacks  as  a  tactical advantage  in  warfare  in  Georgia  and  Ukraine. Russian  focus  continues  to  be  in  propaganda  and pression  (Information  and  Morale  effects)  on  the population.  Moreover,  the  coercive  diplomacy executed by Russia has also failed in both cases [26]. 

## 4.3. **What happened on 24th February?** 

Other  than  the  HermeticWiper,  no  other  malware has been reported in  Ukraine during the invasion. As  stated  before,  Russia  differs  from  western countries  in  its  doctrine.  The  planning  for  the invasion  of 2022 appears to  have relied  on initial shock-and-awe and the assumption that Ukrainian defenses would be disorganized and falter quickly [27].  Thus,  Russian  Command  may  have  been confident in its kinetic capabilities and disregarded the need for cyberwarfare [5]. The pishing links and SMSs, together with propaganda, would have been sufficient to disorganize Ukrainian defenses. 

Meanwhile,  Western  companies  and  ‘Hacktivists’ helped  create  a  Ukrainian  ‘IT’  army  to  counter Russian  attacks.  Furthermore,  the  costs  in  human capital and investments may have been considered too expensive for a campaign Russia thought would be easily won by conventional means [5]. 

## 4.4. **Quantitative Research** 

Cyberwarfare data for quantitative research is often hard to find.  Adebiaye et al. (2016) already hinted at  using  surveys  on  victims  [29]  while  Gazula (2017)  rated  cyberoperations  discretely  using metadata [30], sources from the following years in Ukraine should provide ample space for studies. A possible  innovation  would  be  statistical  approach combining metadata as dummy variables and cost (in equipment or manpower) and number of people affected to create a continuous rating of “impact” of cyberoperations. 

# 5. **Conclusions** 
## 5.1. **Cyber: Bad doctrine or incapacity?** 

Specialists  such  as  Valeriano  et  al.  predicted correctly  that  Ukraine  would  not  be  a  new  era  in cyberwarfare,  and  that  these  operations  are incapable  of  generating  impact  on  themselves  [5], This falls in line with Ashraf’s ‘skeptic’ concept [8]. However,  Russian  coercive  diplomacy  [26]  and military planning [27] have also shown to be badly designed,  therefore  failure  in  the  Russian application  should  not  discredit  the  concept  as  a whole,  as  Israel  proved  that  it  can  achieve significant  results  if  applied  correctly  [28].  Why Isreal succeeded where Russia failed is a topic for future research. 

## 5.2. **New Concepts and Response** 

This  study  used  Richard  Clarke’s  definition  of cyberwar  (as  an  equivalent  to  cyberwarfare)  for simplicity,  but  concepts  such  as  ‘cyber  incidents’ should  be  considered  more  precise  in  future research [26][18]. In fact, a majority of articles on cyberwar  fail  to  give  an  explicit  definition  [8], highlighting  the  need  for  a  reassessment  of  the concepts – such as this paper.

Meanwhile,  this  paper  has  also  proposed  2  new qualitative metrics adapted from J.A. Lewis [14] and ideas for quantitative analysis for future research. 

Finally,  Ukraine  has  shown  that  a  ‘hacktivist’  IT army  and  companies  were  capable  of  neutralizing these  threats  efficiently  (HermeticWiper  was detected the day it was released [23]), countries in the EU – such as the Baltic States - should take these examples in creating forums, groups and networks for response in these cases.
